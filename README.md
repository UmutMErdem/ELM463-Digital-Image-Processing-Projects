# ELM463-Digital-Image-Processing-Projects

### Projects Overview

This repository contains various projects developed as part of the Digital Image Processing (DIP) course. Each project focuses on different aspects and techniques of image processing, providing practical implementations and insights into the following topics:

- **Project 0**: Reads, writes and modifies pixels in PGM format images.

- **Project 1**: Includes image filtering techniques such as Negative, Logarithmic Transform, Power-Law Transform, Averaging and Median Filters. In addition, it performs correlation and normalization operations for images.

- **Project 2**: Applys Laplacian, Gaussian, Unsharp Mask filters to images to sharpen and smooth them. In addition, histogram equalization makes images look better.

- **Project 3**: Frequency domain analysis is performed by applying FFT and IFFT operations to images.

- **Project 4**: In this project, time and frequency domain operations are applied to images. As a result of these operations, improvements were made to the image.

- **Project 5**: In this project, Sobel Gradient operation on images, Global, Otsu and Moving Averages Local Thresholding methods for segmentation purposes were demonstrated.

- **Term Project**: Automatic vehicle license plate detection is an important problem for intelligent transportation systems. In this project, license plates were detected using many image processing methods such as grayscale, morphological operations, edge detection, thresholding, region filtering and feature extraction.
